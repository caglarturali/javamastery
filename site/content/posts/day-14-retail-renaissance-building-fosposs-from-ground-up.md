# Day 14 Summary

## Overview
Started the Fosposs project with a focus on clean architecture, domain modeling, and database infrastructure while setting up a basic desktop interface.

## Project Structure
- Organized as a multi-module Maven project
  - fosposs-common: Core domain and database logic
  - fosposs-desktop: Swing-based user interface
- Clean separation of concerns
- Proper dependency management

## Concepts Covered

### Domain Modeling
- Immutable Product record
- Builder pattern implementation
- Field validation in compact constructor
- Clean separation of mutable and immutable state

### Database Infrastructure
- Provider-agnostic database configuration
- SQLite implementation with connection pooling
- Clean schema management through repositories
- Proper resource handling and connection management

### Repository Pattern
- Generic base repository interface
- Type-safe CRUD operations
- Schema management through static providers
- Comprehensive exception handling

### Desktop UI Foundation
- Native look and feel integration
- Basic window structure with toolbar
- Status bar implementation
- Clean component organization

### Testing Practices
- In-memory SQLite database for testing
- Comprehensive test suite
- Clean test organization
- Proper lifecycle management

## Implementation Progress
- Created Product domain model with builder
- Implemented database infrastructure
- Added SQLite support with connection pooling
- Created ProductRepository with full CRUD
- Set up basic desktop interface
- Established comprehensive test coverage

## Key Takeaways
- Value of clean architecture in project organization
- Builder pattern benefits for object creation
- Importance of proper database abstraction
- Benefits of comprehensive testing
- Clean separation of concerns

## Next Steps
Ready to explore:
- Product management interface
- Search and listing capabilities
- Category management
- Inventory tracking
- Sales processing

## Master's Reflection
The apprentice demonstrated excellent judgment in architectural decisions, particularly in organizing the database infrastructure and domain models. The thoughtful approach to schema management and the clean separation between UI and business logic suggests a strong foundation for the project's growth. The enthusiasm for proper testing and clean code principles indicates a promising path ahead.
