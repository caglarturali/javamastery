# Day 6 Summary

## Overview
Explored JVM architecture concepts, memory management, and control flow patterns while enhancing the Card Game project with debug features and resource management.

## Environment & Tools
- Git workflow with meaningful commits
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Java resource management patterns

## Concepts Covered

### JVM Memory Management
- Stack vs Heap understanding
- Object lifecycle management
- Card recycling implementation
- Reference management patterns

### Resource Management
- AutoCloseable interface implementation
- Try-with-resources pattern
- Scanner resource cleanup
- Proper cleanup patterns

### Display Mode System
- Global configuration management
- DEBUG/PLAYER mode implementations
- Clean string representations
- Consistent output formatting

### Modern Java Features
- Switch expressions

- Record implementations

### Design Patterns & Principles
- Single Responsibility Principle
- Clean Code practices
- Configuration management
- Resource lifecycle management

## Implementation Progress
- Implemented card recycling system with discard pile
- Added proper resource management to GameConsole
- Created system-wide display mode configuration
- Enhanced domain objects with debug information
- Improved console interface and commands

## Key Takeaways
- JVM memory management influences design decisions
- Proper resource cleanup is crucial for robust applications
- Global configuration can enhance debugging capabilities
- String representation can vary based on context
- Clean code principles lead to maintainable solutions

## Next Steps
Ready to explore:
- Advanced control flow patterns
- Additional JVM optimization techniques
- System-wide logging implementation
- Testing strategies

## Master's Reflection
The apprentice demonstrated strong intuition for clean code and system design, particularly in implementing the display mode system. The thoughtful approach to resource management and consistent formatting patterns shows growing maturity in Java development practices. The questions about memory management and cleanup patterns indicate a deeper understanding of Java's underlying mechanisms.
