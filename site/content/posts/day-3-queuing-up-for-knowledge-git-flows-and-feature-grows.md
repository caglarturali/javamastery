# Day 3 Summary

## Overview
Started implementing a reservation system for the Library Management System while learning about Git workflows and exploring Java concepts.

## Environment & Tools
- Set up Git with proper `.gitignore`
- Created first feature branch for reservation system
- Learned IDE shortcuts for multiple cursor selection

## Concepts Covered

### Git Workflow
- Initial repository setup
- Multi-line commit messages
- Feature branching strategy
- IDE integration with Git

### Modern Java Features
- Records for immutable data (Reservation)
- Factory methods for object creation
- Compact constructors with validation
- Access level considerations in records

### Design Patterns & Principles
- Dependency Injection (constructor injection)
- Repository pattern continuation
- Interface design principles
- Factory method pattern

### Java Collections
- Queue interface and LinkedList implementation
- HashMap for efficient lookups
- Collection operations (offer vs add)
- Stream API for validation

## Implementation Progress
- Created Reservation record with validation
- Defined ReservationService interface
- Started InMemoryReservationService implementation
- Implemented reservation validation logic

## Key Takeaways
- Modern Java features support clean, maintainable code
- Interface design requires careful consideration of public API
- Validation should enforce business rules
- Dependency injection supports loose coupling

## Next Steps
Ready to explore:
- Complete ReservationService implementation
- Integration with existing borrowing system
- Exception handling for reservation scenarios
- Testing the reservation system

## Master's Reflection
The apprentice demonstrated growing comfort with Java's type system and modern features, while maintaining a keen eye for practical design considerations. The questions about IDE functionality and Git workflows show a holistic approach to learning the Java ecosystem. The intuitive understanding of when to use specific collection types and validation patterns suggests a promising grasp of Java's strengths.
