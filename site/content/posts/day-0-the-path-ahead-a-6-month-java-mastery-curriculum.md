Before diving into our daily sessions, my AI mentor and I reviewed and discussed this comprehensive 6-month curriculum together. This serves as our roadmap and will be referenced throughout our journey.

# Java Mastery: 6-Month Learning Path

## Overview
This curriculum is designed for an experienced developer aiming to master Java and its ecosystem. The program assumes 6-8 hours of daily dedication (~1,200 hours in total over 180 days) and includes both theoretical learning and practical project work.

## Learning Objectives
- Master core Java and its ecosystem
- Develop enterprise-grade applications
- Understand and implement software engineering best practices
- Learn modern development workflows and tools
- Prepare for professional Java certifications
- Complete a substantial project demonstrating learned skills

## Core References

### Books
- Java: The Complete Reference by Herbert Schildt
- Effective Java by Joshua Bloch
- High-Performance Java Persistence by Vlad Mihalcea
- Clean Code by Robert C. Martin

### Official Documentation
- Oracle Java Documentation and Tutorials
- Spring Framework Documentation
- Selenium WebDriver Documentation
- JUnit 5 User Guide
- Maven/Gradle Documentation

## Project Work
Starting from Month 4, a significant project will begin and continue until the end of the program. This project will run parallel to the studies and should incorporate concepts as they are learned.
