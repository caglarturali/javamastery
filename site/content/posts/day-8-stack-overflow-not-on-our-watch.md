Today we ventured into the realm of data structures, implementing our own generic stack while restructuring our project organization. It's one thing to use Java's built-in collections, but building them from scratch? That's where the real learning happens!

# Day 8 Summary

## Overview
Restructured project organization and implemented a generic stack data structure with modern Java features while focusing on clean code principles and API design.

## Environment & Tools
- Reorganized packages to reflect domain ownership (blog.javamastery.*)
- Proper package structure for data structures and common utilities
- IntelliJ IDEA refactoring tools

## Concepts Covered

### Project Organization
- Domain-based package naming
- Separation of concerns in package structure
- Common utilities isolation
- Test code organization

### Data Structure Implementation
- Generic type handling
- Array growth and shrinkage strategies
- Memory management considerations
- Clean API design

### Modern Java Features
- Generic types with arrays
- Iterator implementation
- Stream API integration
- Custom interface design

### Clean Code Practices
- Consistent exception handling
- Single responsibility methods
- Clear naming conventions
- Comprehensive testing approach

## Implementation Progress
- Created SimpleStack<T> implementation
- Added dynamic array resizing
- Implemented iteration support
- Created Streamable interface
- Built comprehensive test cases

## Key Takeaways
- Importance of proper package organization
- Array-based implementation considerations
- Generic type handling in Java
- Iterator and Stream API integration
- Memory management strategies

## Next Steps
Ready to explore:
- Queue implementation
- Concurrent operations
- Lock-free data structures
- Collection interface integration

## Master's Reflection
The apprentice demonstrated excellent judgment in API design and implementation details. The evolution from basic array management to a full-featured stack with iteration and streaming capabilities shows growing mastery of Java's ecosystem. The attention to memory management and clean code principles suggests a strong foundation for tackling more complex data structures.
