# Day 4 Summary

## Overview
Completed the reservation system implementation and started a new card game project, focusing on clean domain modeling and modern Java features.

## Environment & Tools
- Practiced proper Git workflow
  - Feature branch management
  - Meaningful commit messages
  - Branch switching and merging
- Used zsh Git shortcuts effectively

## Concepts Covered

### Reservation System Completion
- Optional usage for null safety
- Queue operations (peek vs poll)
- Stream operations for collection manipulation
- Proper exception handling
- Event notification patterns

### Card Game Foundation
- Domain modeling with immutable types
- Enum usage and customization
- String manipulation utilities
- Collection operations

### Modern Java Features
- Records for immutable data
- Enhanced switch expressions
- String formatting
- List operations (removeLast)
- Stream collectors

### Design Patterns & Principles
- Immutable value objects
- Single responsibility principle
- Utility class patterns
- Clean code naming conventions

## Implementation Progress
- Completed ReservationService implementation
- Created foundation for card game:
  - Card, Rank, and Suit implementations
  - Deck management
  - Card drawing mechanisms
  - toString representations

## Key Takeaways
- Java's modern features support clean, expressive code
- Importance of proper string representation
- Value of distinguishing between display and debug formats
- Collection choice impacts performance

## Next Steps
Ready to explore:
- Card game rule implementation
- Hand evaluation
- Player management
- Game state handling

## Master's Reflection
The apprentice demonstrated growing mastery of Java's modern features while maintaining clean code principles. Their attention to Git workflow and ability to distinguish between different string representation needs shows a deepening understanding of professional Java development practices. The intuitive grasp of when to use specific collection operations and modern Java features suggests a strong foundation for the more complex game logic to come.
