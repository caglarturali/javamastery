# Day 7 Summary

## Overview
Explored JVM architecture through our practical projects while evolving the Library Management System to use immutable records for state management.

## Environment & Tools
- Proper Java version management (OpenJDK 21)
- Git workflow
- Package structure and compilation
- JVM verbose class loading

## Concepts Covered

### JVM Architecture
- Class loading lifecycle
- Dynamic class loading patterns
- Memory management principles
- Garbage collection basics

### Immutability Patterns
- Record types for borrowing events
- State vs Event sourcing
- Clean separation of concerns
- Audit trail implementation

### System Evolution
- Removed mutable state from BookCopy
- Introduced BorrowingRecord
- Enhanced BorrowingService responsibilities
- Improved interface segregation

### Resource Management
- Proper datetime formatting
- String representation patterns
- Efficient optional handling
- History tracking implementation

## Implementation Progress
- Created immutable BorrowingRecord
- Updated BorrowingService for history tracking
- Simplified BookCopy class
- Enhanced system observability
- Improved separation of concerns

## Key Takeaways
- JVM's efficient handling of immutable objects
- Benefits of event-sourced state management
- Clean separation of responsibilities
- Importance of proper version management
- Value of comprehensive audit trails

## Next Steps
Ready to explore:
- Advanced data structures
- Algorithms fundamentals
- Collection framework deep dive
- Implementation patterns

## Master's Reflection
The apprentice demonstrated excellent judgment in system design, particularly in recognizing the benefits of moving from state-based to event-sourced architecture. The thoughtful approach to immutability and clean separation of concerns suggests a strong grasp of Java's strengths. The curiosity about JVM internals while maintaining focus on practical implementation shows a balanced learning approach.
