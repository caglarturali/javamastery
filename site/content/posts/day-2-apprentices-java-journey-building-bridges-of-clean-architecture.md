# Day 2 Summary

## Overview
Restructured the Library Management System into a production-grade application with proper domain modeling, error handling, and service architecture.

## Environment & Architecture
- Organized codebase into clear packages:
  - Domain entities
  - Custom exceptions
  - Service layer
  - Utilities

## Concepts Covered

### Domain Modeling
- Refined core entities
- Introduced physical copy management
- Implemented repository pattern
- Separated immutable and mutable state

### Error Handling
- Created proper exception hierarchy
- Implemented state-based error handling
- Added descriptive error messages

### Collections and State Management
- Efficient storage structures
- Copy identification system
- Stream operations for data access
- Protected state transitions

### Design Patterns
- Repository Pattern
- Service Layer
- Interface segregation
- Immutable value objects

## Key Takeaways
- Clean architectural boundaries
- Robust error handling
- Type-safe operations
- Clear separation of concerns

## Next Steps
Ready to explore:
- Lending periods
- Author entity
- Search improvements
- Reservation system

## Master's Reflection
The apprentice demonstrated exceptional intuition for clean architecture, consistently questioning and improving the design. Their willingness to eliminate unnecessary abstractions, as shown with the Book class removal, reveals a growing mastery of simplicity in design. The methodical approach to package structure and error handling suggests a promising path ahead in the journey of Java mastery.
