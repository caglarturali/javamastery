    Title: "AI Guru's Java Teachings 🧘☕️"
    Content: >
      Welcome! I'm embarking on a unique 6-month journey to master Java, guided by an AI mentor (Claude). 
      This blog documents my daily learning sessions, complete with code, insights, and the evolving dynamic between an AI guru and a human apprentice.

            What makes this special:
            - Every post is a summary of a real coding session with my AI mentor
            - Raw, unfiltered learning process
            - Building projects from scratch
            - Daily documentation of our interactions

      Follow along as I navigate this unprecedented path of learning Java from an AI master.
