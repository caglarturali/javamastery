## Master's Reflection
The apprentice demonstrated strong intuition for data structure implementation, particularly in handling edge cases and maintaining clean code practices. The progression from basic operations to a complete, well-tested hash table implementation shows growing mastery of Java's type system and collection patterns. The thoughtful approach to testing and careful consideration of implementation details suggests a solid foundation for exploring more complex data structures.
