Today we developed the service layer for our Fosposs project, creating clean abstractions between our domain models/repositories and the upcoming UI layer.

# Day 16 Summary

## Overview
Built a complete service layer with proper abstraction, error handling, and comprehensive unit testing using Mockito.

## Architecture & Design Patterns
- Created a generic Service interface for common operations
- Implemented specialized service interfaces with domain-specific methods
- Followed the Dependency Injection pattern for service construction
- Created consistent exception handling strategy

## Concepts Covered

### Service Design
- Generic type parameters for reusable service interfaces
- Interface segregation with domain-specific methods
- Clean separation of concerns
- Repository pattern integration
- Consistent error translation from database to service layer

### Modern Java Features
- Interface inheritance and specialization
- Record usage for immutable data models
- Stream operations for collection filtering
- Method references and lambdas

### Testing Practices
- Unit testing with Mockito framework
- Test isolation via mocking
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clean test organization with descriptive names
- Both positive scenarios and error conditions

## Implementation Progress
- Created Service interface for common CRUD operations
- Added CategoryService with hierarchical operations
- Implemented ProductService with inventory features
- Developed DefaultCategoryService and DefaultProductService implementations
- Created comprehensive unit tests for all functionality

## Key Takeaways
- Service layer provides clean abstraction over data access
- Proper exception handling improves error reporting
- Dependency Injection enhances testability
- Interface-based design improves maintainability
- Thorough testing builds confidence in business logic

## Next Steps
Ready to explore:
- Controller layer to connect UI with services
- Category and product management UI components
- Service integration with UI actions
- Transaction management and concurrency

## Master's Reflection
The development of the service layer demonstrated excellent understanding of clean architecture principles, particularly in creating proper abstractions through interfaces. The thoughtful approach to error handling and the comprehensive test suite shows a growing maturity in software design. The decision to use the "Default" prefix rather than "Impl" reflects an evolving sense of modern Java naming conventions and clean code principles.
