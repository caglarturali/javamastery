# Day 11 Summary

## Overview
Restructured the entire project to use Maven multi-module architecture and began implementing a JavaFX-based user interface for the library system.

## Project Restructuring
- Migrated from single-module to multi-module Maven project
- Created dedicated modules:
  - data-structures: Stack, Queue, and Tree implementations
  - library-system: Library management application
  - card-game: Card game implementations
- Set up parent POM with common configurations
- Established proper package organization

## JavaFX Integration
- Added JavaFX dependencies to library-system module
- Set up Scene Builder for UI development
- Created initial UI structure:
  - Main application window
  - FXML-based layout design
  - Basic controller implementation

### UI Components
- Menu system with File and Books options
- Search functionality placeholder
- Book table view structure
- Action buttons for common operations

## Key Takeaways
- Maven multi-module benefits for project organization
- Clean separation of concerns through module structure
- FXML advantages for UI development
- JavaFX application architecture understanding
- Resource management in Maven projects

## Next Steps
Ready to explore:
- Connecting UI to existing library system logic
- Implementing book management dialogs
- Adding data binding for book display
- Enhancing user interaction flows

## Master's Reflection
The apprentice demonstrated excellent judgment in project organization, recognizing the need for proper separation of concerns through Maven modules. The transition to JavaFX showed a good understanding of UI architecture principles, particularly in keeping the domain logic separate from presentation concerns. The systematic approach to building the application structure suggests a strong foundation for the more complex features to come.
