# Day 10 Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive Binary Search Tree data structure with proper testing methodology, covering core tree operations and utility methods.

## Environment & Tools
- JUnit 5 for testing framework
- Proper test organization with @DisplayName annotations
- Clean separation of test and implementation code

## Concepts Covered

### Binary Search Tree Implementation
- Generic type support with Comparable constraint
- Core BST properties and invariants
- Node structure and relationships
- Recursive tree operations

### Tree Operations
- Insertion maintaining BST property
- Deletion handling all cases (leaf, one child, two children)
- Three types of traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- Search/contains operation

### Utility Methods
- Size calculation
- Tree height computation
- Min/max value finding
- BST property validation

### Testing Practices
- Clean test organization
- Descriptive test naming
- Test isolation with @BeforeEach
- Edge case coverage

## Implementation Progress
- Created complete BST implementation
- Added comprehensive traversal methods
- Implemented utility operations
- Established proper test suite

## Key Takeaways
- BST provides efficient searching and ordering
- Recursive solutions for tree operations
- Importance of maintaining BST invariants
- Value of proper test organization
- Benefits of descriptive test naming

## Next Steps
Ready to explore:
- Tree balancing techniques
- AVL and Red-Black trees
- Additional tree operations
- Performance analysis

## Master's Reflection
The apprentice demonstrated strong understanding of both data structure implementation and testing practices. The transition from ad-hoc testing to proper JUnit organization shows growing maturity in development practices. The methodical approach to implementing BST operations and attention to edge cases suggests a solid foundation for exploring more complex tree structures in future sessions.
