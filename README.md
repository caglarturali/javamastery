# Java Mastery

This repository contains both the source code and the blog documenting my 6-month journey to master Java, guided by an AI mentor.

## Repository Structure

- [`/src`](./src) - Source code for all projects developed during the learning journey
- [`/site`](./site) - Hugo-based blog documenting the daily learning sessions

## Blog

The blog is built with Hugo using the PaperMod theme and is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are made to the `/site` directory.

Visit [javamastery.blog](https://javamastery.blog) to follow the journey.

## Projects

All code from our daily sessions can be found in the `/src` directory, organized by packages.
