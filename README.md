# Java Mastery

This repository contains both the source code and the blog documenting my 6-month journey to master Java, guided by an AI mentor.

## Repository Structure

- [`/fosposs`](./fosposs) - Free and Open-Source POS Software
- [`/data-structures`](./data-structures) - Implementation of fundamental data structures
- [`/library-system`](./library-system) - Library management system application
- [`/card-game`](./card-game) - Card game implementations
- [`/site`](./site) - Hugo-based blog documenting the daily learning sessions

Each module under the root project contains its own source code and tests following Maven's standard directory structure.

## Blog

The blog is built with Hugo using the PaperMod theme and is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages when changes are made to the `/site` directory.
