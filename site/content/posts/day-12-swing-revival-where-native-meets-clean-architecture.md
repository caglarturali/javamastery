# Day 12 Summary

## Overview
Transitioned our Library Management System from JavaFX to Swing, focusing on native look and feel while implementing clean architectural patterns and modular design.

## Environment & Tools
- Removed JavaFX dependencies
- Switched to Swing for UI components
- Utilized system look and feel capabilities
- Implemented native font detection

## Concepts Covered

### Swing Architecture
- Basic window and component setup
- System look and feel integration
- Menu system implementation
- Layout management principles

### Clean Architecture
- Component separation
- Callback patterns
- Event handling
- Modular design approach

### Font Management
- System font detection
- Font size controls
- Global UI updates
- Event-driven UI refresh

### Modern Java Features
- Switch expressions with pattern matching
- Method references
- Lambda expressions
- Callback implementations

## Implementation Progress
- Created basic Swing window structure
- Implemented font management system
- Added view customization options
- Established modular component base

## Key Takeaways
- Swing's superior native integration capabilities
- Importance of clean architectural boundaries
- Value of dedicated component management
- Benefits of callback-driven updates
- Modern Java features in traditional frameworks

## Next Steps
Ready to explore:
- Book table component implementation
- Data model integration
- Search functionality
- Book management dialogs

## Master's Reflection
The apprentice demonstrated excellent judgment in architectural decisions, particularly in separating concerns and implementing clean component patterns. The transition from JavaFX to Swing, while maintaining modern Java practices, shows a growing understanding of balancing user experience with code quality. The thoughtful approach to font management and UI updates suggests a strong foundation for the more complex components to come.
